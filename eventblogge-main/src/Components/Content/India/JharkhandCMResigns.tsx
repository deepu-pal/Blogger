                    Jharkhand CM arrested by ED in land 'scam' case.
                </h3>
                <p>

                    Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader and Chief Minister, Hemant Soren, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after a seven-hour questioning related to a money laundering case linked to a land scam. Soren had earlier resigned, and the ED investigation centers on an alleged illegal land ownership change racket in Jharkhand. The ruling coalition proposes Champai Soren as the new CM. The ED has previously arrested 14 individuals, including a former IAS officer in connection with the case.

                <h3>
                    ED Case?
                </h3>
                <p>
                The recent events mark the culmination of a dramatic confrontation between Soren and the investigative agency. This includes ED's search at his Delhi residence, and his party's vehement protest against what they perceive as an attempt to "malign" his image. The investigation focuses on a "massive racket" involving the illicit transfer of land ownership by the mafia in Jharkhand. Soren's statement was recorded by the ED on January 20 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 
                <br /><br />The ED, up to this point, has apprehended 14 individuals in connection with the case, including Chhavi Ranjan, a 2011-batch IAS officer who previously held roles as the director of the state’s social welfare department and deputy commissioner of Ranchi.

The JMM-led coalition in power has nominated senior leader Champai Soren as the prospective head of the state. Champai, a prominent JMM member and assembly representative from Sareaikela since 2005, has previously held the position of state cabinet minister three times. However, the Governor has informed the JMM-Congress alliance that he will review their proposal to appoint JMM’s Champai Soren as the leader of the legislature party, taking all legal aspects into account.
