                    Missing Jharkhand CM <strong>Hemant Soren</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Hemant Soren  is an Indian politician from Jharkhand, who is the 5th and current Chief Minister of Jharkhand. He is also the working president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a political party in Jharkhand. He represents Barhait constituency in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly since 2014 and from Dumka from 2019 to 2020. <br />
                    Chief Minister Hemant Soren was reported to be “missing" for several hours before resurfacing in Ranchi, the state capital, on Tuesday. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader went to Delhi for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case, but the federal agency said that it failed to locate the leader. However, the federal agency investigators found some ‘incriminating’ evidence when they searched his residence and seized his BMW car and ₹36 lakh in cash.
                    <br /> As the word spreads, the BJP in Jharkhand claimed that the chief minister was absconding and even asked the Governor to take note of the matter. "It is the job of the Governor, I am doing it. We will cross the bridge when it comes," Jharkhand Governor CP Radhakrishnan said. <br />
                    But the chief minister arrived at his residence on Tuesday and held a meeting with the members of the ruling alliance in Jharkhand. Hemant Soren has said that he is ready for the questioning and will depose before the ED on Wednesday at 1:00 PM. The people close to the chief minister said that he went to Delhi for legal consultations in his case and while the ED kept a close watch at Delhi airport, Hemant Soren chose to make the 1,200 km return trip to Ranchi by road.

                <h3>Hemant Soren has written a letter to the Enforcement Directorate (ED). </h3>
                <p>
                    “You are well aware that the Budget Session of the Legislative Assembly will be held between 2nd and 29th February 2024 and the undersigned will be preoccupied with preparations for the same apart from other prior scheduled official engagements," reads the letter.
                    <br />“In these circumstances, your insistence to record a further statement of the undersigned on or before 31st January 2024 rocks of malice and reveals your political agenda to disrupt the functioning of the State Government and prevent an elected representative of the people from discharging his official duties," he further wrote.
