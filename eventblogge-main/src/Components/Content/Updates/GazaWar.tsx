        <p>Hundreds of foreign nationals and dozens of seriously injured Palestinians have been allowed to leave Gaza for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began more than three weeks ago. 
            Their departures through the Rafah crossing into Egypt follow the release of four hostages by Hamas and the rescue of an Israeli soldier.</p>
        <p>The opening of the border crossing came as Israeli forces advanced deeper into Gaza and airstrikes on Wednesday struck a refugee camp for a second time in as many days.</p>
       
        <p>Communications and internet services were gradually being restored after the second major cut in five days, according to Paltel, the main telecommunications provider. Humanitarian aid agencies have warned that such blackouts severely disrupt their work in an already dire situation in Gaza.</p>
       
        <p>The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has reached 8,805, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, 130 Palestinians have been killed in violence and Israeli raids.</p>
        <p>More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, most of them civilians slain in the initial Oct. 7 Hamas rampage that started the fighting. In addition, around 240 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza by the militant group. One of the captives, a female Israeli soldier, was rescued in a special forces operation.</p>
        <h2>Here’s what is happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war.</h2>
        <p>Biden praises efforts to help foreign nationals and injured Palestinians leave Gaza</p>
        <p>NORTHFIELD, Minn. — President Joe Biden cheered regional partners for their help paving the way for some wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals, including some U.S. citizens, to escape Gaza.</p>
        <p>“I personally spent a lot of time speaking with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and President Sissi of Egypt and others, to make sure that we could open this access for people to get out,” Biden said during a 
            visit Wednesday to Northfield, Minn. “I want to thank our partners, in particular Qatar, who worked so closely with us to support negotiations to facilitate the departure of these citizens.”</p>
        <p>Biden said more work needs to be done to “significantly step up the flow of critical humanitarian assistance into Gaza.”</p>
        <p>Biden reiterated that he backs Israel’s right to defend itself “in a manner that is consistent with international humanitarian law.” But he also acknowledged the suffering endured by Palestinians during the Israeli operations.</p>
        <p>“We’ve all seen the devastating images from Gaza,” Biden noted. “Palestinian children crying out for lost parents … writing on their hands and legs to be indemnified if the worst happens.”</p>
        <p>Death toll among UNRWA staff in Gaza rises to 70</p>
        <p>CAIRO — In a report issued Wednesday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNWRA, said the number of its workers killed in the ongoing conflict in Gaza now stands at 70. 
            The group said that more than 690,000 displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 149 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>UNRWA’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, crossed into Gaza on Wednesday, meeting with Palestinians and also aid groups. In a statement that followed, 
            Lazzarini reiterated UNRWA’s call for fuel to enter Gaza and for a humanitarian cease-fire.</p>
        <p>“Without it (a cease-fire), more people will be killed, those who are alive will endure further losses, and the once vibrant society will be in grief, forever,” Lazzarini said.</p>
        <h2>Several U.S. citizens among foreign nationals that have departed Gaza, State Department says</h2>
        <p>WASHINGTON — The State Department has confirmed that a number of U.S. citizens trapped in Gaza have crossed into Egypt after a deal was reached to allow foreigners to leave the enclave.</p>
        <p>“An initial group of foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, departed Gaza through Rafah today, and we expect exits of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals to continue over the next several days,” department spokesman Matthew Miller said.</p>
        <p>He declined to say how many Americans had made it to Egypt on Wednesday but said there were consular officials on hand to assist them.</p>
        <p>Roughly 400 American citizens in Gaza have told the State Department they want to leave the territory and, with family members, U.S. officials say they are looking at about 1,000 people who they are seeking to get out, Miller said.</p>
        <p>“In the past 24 hours we have informed U.S. citizens and their family and family members with whom we are in contact that they will be assigned specific departure dates. We’ve asked them to continue to monitor their email regularly over the next 24 to 72 hours for specific instructions about how to exit,” Miller said.</p>
        <h2>UN secretary-general condemns civilian killings, says he’s appalled by escalating violence</h2>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “is appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza” including the killing of Palestinians by Israeli airstrikes in the Jabaliya refugee camp on Tuesday and Wednesday, his spokesman says.</p>
        <p>Dujarric said: “The secretary-general reiterates that all parties must abide by international law, international humanitarian law including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution.”</p>
        <p>The U.N. chief also reiterated his call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages taken from Israel by Hamas during its surprise attacks on Oct. 7, Dujarric said. And he called again “for the entry of vital humanitarian assistance at a scale needed to meet the mounting needs of the Palestinian population.”</p>
        <h2>5 French citizens among those to leave Gaza through Rafah crossing</h2>
        <p>PARIS — Five French citizens were among dozens of dual passport holders and seriously injured who were able to leave the Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing Wednesday, the French Foreign Ministry said. A team from the French Embassy in Egypt awaited for the group and France thanked Egyptian authorities for facilitating the exit.</p>
        <p>“We reiterate our call to protect all civilian populations in Gaza,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The ministry said last month that several dozen French citizens and their families were in Gaza — including residents and those visiting family or in a humanitarian capacity.</p>
        <p>French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated on Wednesday during a visit to Kazakhstan the need for protection of the civilian population caught up in the Israel-Hamas war that has killed thousands, including 1,400 Israelis and more than 8,700 Palestinians.</p>
        <p>“We say the way to protect yourself should be compliant with international law … You have to attack and punish the terrorist group Hamas (but) you have to protect civilians in your counter-attack,” Macron said.</p>
        <p>His remarks to students in Astana were in response to a question and directed at Israel.</p>
